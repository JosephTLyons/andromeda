Quickly create large amounts of unique serial numbers.  Heavily
inspired by [random code generator](https://www.randomcodegenerator.com/en/generate-serial-numbers).

## Creating Unique Serial Numbers

Making a batch of unique licenses is very simple. Run the script with:

```shell
./main.py
```

Let's go ahead and create `1000` serial numbers.  We want the serial numbers to
be `20` symbols long and we want to include numbers, uppercase letters, and
lowercase letters, but not symbols:

```text
Serial number amount: 1000
Serial number length: 20
Enter 'y' to use numbers: y
Enter 'y' to use uppercase letters: y
Enter 'y' to use lowercase letters: y
Enter 'y' to use symbols: n
```

When we are done, we will find a new file within the same folder as this script
named `1000_unique_serials.txt`.  Opening the file, we see:

```text

```

## How it Works

1. Check to make sure that it is possible to create the amount of unique
   licenses requested based on the the serial number length and character set.  
   For example, if the user requests `1,000,000` unique licenses, but only asks
   for serial numbers of length `4` and wants only numbers as characters, it
   will not be possible, as `10^4 < 1,000,000`.  We must have more possible
   combinations than the number of licenses requested in order to ensure all
   licenses will be unique.
2. Make a `characterList` that is comprised of all the symbols the user wishes
   to use in their serial numbers (numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase
   letters, and symbols).
3. Shuffle this list and push a copy of it into another list, called
   `listOfCharacterLists`.  This step is executed as many times as the length of
   the serial number requested.
4. Create a new list of numbers called `indexList`.  Each cell in this list
   holds an index that corresponds to a `characterList` in the
   `listOfCharacterLists`.
5. A serial number is generated by using the `indexList` to provide an index
   to each of the corresponding internal `characterList`s in
   `listOfCharacterLists`.  The `listOfCharacterLists` contains as many internal
   `characterList`s as the length of our serial number.  This can be seen sort
   of as a speedometer that starts with `0000` miles.  As we roll through the
   miles in the rightmost column, it resets back to zero and the next value to
   the left increments by `1`.  This is exactly how the `indexList` and
   `listOfCharacterLists` work to obtain serial numbers.

In order to avoid printing serial numbers that look like this:

```text
PWZdySrxntWyBxYYZAlT
PWZdySrxntWyBxYYZAlB
PWZdySrxntWyBxYYZAlZ
PWZdySrxntWyBxYYZAlJ
...
```

we need to pull serial numbers evenly over the entire spectrum of possible
combinations.  We can do this by taking the total possible combinations based
on the user settings and dividing it by the number of licenses needed.  This
will give us the value that we need to be apply to the `indexList` before
printing the next serial number to the file.  Using the example from earlier:

```text
Serial number amount: 1000
Serial number length: 20
Enter 'y' to use numbers: y
Enter 'y' to use uppercase letters: y
Enter 'y' to use lowercase letters: y
Enter 'y' to use symbols: n
```

Our licenses are of length `20` and use `62` types of symbols (`10` numbers +
`26` lowercase letters + `26` uppercase letters).  We have `62^20` possible
unique serial number combinations.  Because we want `1000` licenses, the spacing
between serial numbers to be printed to the file is
`(62^20)/1000 = 704423425546998022968330264616370`.  If we set
`n = 704423425546998022968330264616370`, then the function
`increaseIndexVectorBy()` efficiently applies this number to the `indexList` in
roughly `log(n) with base 62` operations.  Using this method, we are able to
print licenses that are equally spaced apart in the total combination space, as
shown in the first sample output earlier.

We can even print all of the values of the `indexListr` to the terminal to see
the patterns better by uncommenting the function `printIndexList()`:

```text

## Pitfalls to be Aware of

Andromeda does not care if you choose settings that result in a very low pool of
license combinations.  You should be aware of this.  If you run the application
with the following options:

```text
Serial number amount: 1000
Serial number length: 4
Enter 'y' to use numbers: y
Enter 'y' to use uppercase letters: n
Enter 'y' to use lowercase letters: n
Enter 'y' to use symbols: n
```

the output will be:

```text
9444
9474
9494
9464
9484
9434
9424
9404
9414
9454
9244
9274
9294
9264
9284
9234
...
```

Notice that the licenses are fairly similar.  Also, note that it would be fairly
easy to guess a serial number.  The probability that a random guess would be an
actual serial number is `1000/(10^4) = 0.1`.  It is up to the user to understand
this and adjust the settings to increase the complexity of the output and
decrease the chances of guessing a license number.  Using the example from
earlier with `1000` serial numbers of length `20` using all symbols, the
probability that a random guess would be an actual serial number is
`1000/(62^20) = 1.4196007e-33`.

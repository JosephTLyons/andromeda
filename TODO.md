# TODO:

## Must Do:

- Any Python optimizations
- Clean code / refactor more
- Double check all of README.md and fix discrepancies between code / README.md
  and double check all math
- Can math notation be used in README.md?
- Fix `main()`, not clean code, no error checking, should probably be using
  stdin over the crate
- Write in more idiomatic Python way?
- Bring into a class and write unit tests?
- Use an actual "main" entry point function

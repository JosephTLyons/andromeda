# TODO:

## Must Do:

- Any Python optimizations
- Clean code / refactor more
- Double check all of README.md and fix discrepancies between code / README.md
  and double check all math
- Can math notation be used in README.md?
- Fix `main()`, not clean code, no error checking, should probably be using
  stdin over the crate
- Write in more idiomatic Python way?
- Bring into a class and write unit tests?
- Use an actual "main" entry point function

## Python Discord suggestions
- Follow official Python style guide and update readme
- use pathlib to create path to the file to keep it OS agnostic
- use another module for creating the file name?
- context manager for opening an closing files
- enumerate might be better than for x in reversed(range(0, len(indexVctor)))
- enumerate is used in place of range(len(list)) whenever possible
- Two Comprehension samples (can't get these to work)
- A package to add the correct endline when concatenating "\n"
- A less biased shuffle that will offer all permutations? `Choices`?

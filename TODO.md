# TODO:

## Code Additions

- Any Python optimizations
- Write unit tests?
- Have user enter in options first and display the total number of licenses
  possible before asking how many they want?
- Context manager for opening an closing files

## Code Changes

- Follow official Python style guide and update readme
- Clean code / refactor more (OOP)
- Double check all of README.md and fix discrepancies between code / README.md
  and double check all math
- In README, use the word "base"
- Can math notation be used in README.md?
- Write in more idiomatic Python way?
- Reduce line length back down under 100 characters
- Two Comprehension samples (can't get these to work)

## Error Handling

- Should I care if `main()` handles error on user input?
- Should I care if file operations handle error?

# TODO:

## Must Do:

- Any Python optimizations
- Clean code / refactor more
- Double check all of README.md and fix discrepancies (make sure to update it
  to the Python version)
- Can math notation be used in README.md?
- Fix interface, not clean code, no error checking, should probably be using
  stdin over the crate
- Write in more idiomatic Python way
- Bring into a class and write unit tests?
- Use a "main" function
